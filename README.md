# Purpose of the app: 
The app is used to compare the prices of food or other items. The reduced 
and conventional product prices are displayed. This allows you to find the 
cheapest products and save money. You can use the shopping basket function 
to create a shopping list and plan your next purchase. Purchased products 
can be crossed off the list during shopping so that the list is always up 
to date. To save a product for later, you can add it to your favourites list.

# Brief user guide:
The app can be used to discover discounts on food or other items. Data from 
various shops is available which is loaded of the Preisrunter.at API. The data 
can be filtered by the desired shop and sorted by price or product name. It is 
also possible to search for specific products. The products can be saved in the 
favourites list or can be added directly to the shopping list (shopping basket). 
By clicking on a product you can see the product page. Information such as vegan, 
vegetarian, gluten-free or lactose-free can be viewed on the product page if the 
product has these characteristics. As this function is new, it is not available 
for all products. One product that shows this properties is "BILLA Eistee Wassermelone".
