# Purpose of the app: 
The app can be used to discover price reductions on food or other items. 
Therefore data from various shops is available. The data can be filtered 
by the desired shop and sorted by price or product name. It is also possible 
to search for specific items. Products can be saved in the favourites list 
or can be added directly to the shopping list (shopping basket).
